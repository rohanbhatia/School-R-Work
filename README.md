This repository contains some of the work I have done in my Statistics courses at the University of Toronto St. George:<br />

STA248H1: Statistics for Computer Scientists<br />
For this course, some of the scripts answer questions in "Introduction to Probability and Statistics: Principles and Applications for Engineering and the Computing Sciences" by Milton/Arnold, 4th Edition. The questions are included, but not in their entirety: if this causes any issues please contact me.<br />
